# 💚 HuMaan: AI-Powered Mental Health Support for Students

**HuMaan** is an AI-driven mental health support system designed specifically for students. With increasing academic pressures like assignments, exams, and practicals — alongside unhealthy habits such as irregular sleep and poor nutrition — students often experience a decline in both mental and physical well-being.

This project introduces an AI-integrated platform that provides personalized mental health support to help students manage stress, reduce anxiety, and promote healthier lifestyles. Over time, these small yet consistent improvements contribute to long-term emotional stability and personal growth.

- Users receive **daily goals** to support their mental well-being.

### 3. Continuous Monitoring & Feedback
- The app tracks user activity and interaction with plans.
- Users submit feedback on activities.
- Plans are updated based on performance and feedback.

### 4. Improvement Cycle
- The feedback loop continues until a stable, healthy state is reached.
- AI adjusts strategies to meet the evolving mental state of the user.
