# üíö HuMaan: AI-Powered Mental Health Support for Students

**HuMaan** is an AI-driven, confidential, and empathetic mental wellness platform designed specifically for students and young adults. Facing intense academic pressures ‚Äî such as assignments, exams, and practicals ‚Äî alongside lifestyle challenges like irregular sleep and poor nutrition, many students experience a decline in both mental and physical well-being.

This project leverages AI and Google Cloud‚Äôs generative AI to deliver personalized mental health support, helping students manage stress, reduce anxiety, and develop healthier routines. By providing consistent, culturally sensitive guidance in a safe and private environment, HuMaan empowers students to cultivate emotional resilience, promote long-term well-being, and foster personal growth.

## üß† Methodology

### 1. User Onboarding
- **New users** take a quiz to evaluate their current mental health status.
- Based on the results, the application generates a **personalized plan**.

### 2. Personalized Plans
- AI suggests **daily tasks** tailored to the user‚Äôs mental health assessment.
- Users receive **daily goals** to support their mental well-being.

### 3. Continuous Monitoring & Feedback
- The app tracks user activity and interaction with plans.
- Users submit feedback on activities.
- Plans are updated based on performance and feedback.

### 4. Improvement Cycle
- The feedback loop continues until a stable, healthy state is reached.
- AI adjusts strategies to meet the evolving mental state of the user.
