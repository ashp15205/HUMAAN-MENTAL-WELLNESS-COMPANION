# 💚 HuMaan: AI-Powered Mental Health Support for Students

**HuMaan** is an AI-driven, confidential, and empathetic mental wellness platform designed specifically for students and young adults. Facing intense academic pressures — such as assignments, exams, and practicals — alongside lifestyle challenges like irregular sleep and poor nutrition, many students experience a decline in both mental and physical well-being.

This project leverages AI and Google Cloud’s generative AI to deliver personalized mental health support, helping students manage stress, reduce anxiety, and develop healthier routines. By providing consistent, culturally sensitive guidance in a safe and private environment, HuMaan empowers students to cultivate emotional resilience, promote long-term well-being, and foster personal growth.
